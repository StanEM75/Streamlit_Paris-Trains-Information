## üöÄ Introduction

In Paris, there is a monthly pass that provides access to all public transportation in the city. It is called Navigo Pass.<br><br>
Partnerships exist with Parisian stores and cultural venues to offer special deals to Navigo Pass holders.<br><br>
These deals include both discounts and dedicated services.<br><br>
One of the goals of this project is to showcase to Navigo subscribers all the promotions they can access.<br><br>
The other objective is to give access to the expected arrival times for the next trains of the Parisian metro.
